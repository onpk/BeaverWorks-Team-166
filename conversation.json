Of course, you're welcome to join us. We're here to chat and hang out. What's been on your mind lately? Feel free to share.\n\nSarah: Thanks for having me. Lately, I've been feeling overwhelmed with schoolwork and some personal stuff. It's been a lot to handle.\n\nYou: I understand, Sarah. It's totally okay to feel that way sometimes. We're here to listen and support you. Is there anything in particular that's been weighing on you, or do you want to talk about anything in particular to unwind?\n\nSarah: I guess I just needed a break from everything and to talk to someone who would listen. It's nice to have friends like you who are willing to chat.\n\nYou: We're here for you, Sarah. Feel free to share as much or as little as you're comfortable with. Sometimes just talking about things can help lighten the load. Remember, we're all in this together, and you're not alone."
